# VNX Translation Core

The game-loading engine half of **[Viridite](https://github.com/Viridite/Viridite)** — an Android NDK compatibility layer that runs a game's real Android `.so` binary natively on Nintendo Switch, instead of emulating anything. If you're looking for the app you actually launch on your Switch, that's the [Viridite launcher repo](https://github.com/Viridite/Viridite); this repo is the engine it hands off to.

## What lives here

- **`VNX-Translation-Core-x64`** — the real engine: custom ARM64 ELF loader (JIT dual-mapping, relocation, symbol resolution), a JNI/JavaVM emulation layer, real pthreads, real audio (SDL2_mixer), real accelerometer/gyroscope/battery via libnx. Built from `source/` + `source/compat/` at the repo root.
- **`VNX-Translation-Core-x32`** (`core32/`) — a placeholder. 32-bit (`armeabi-v7a`) Android binaries aren't supported yet — running AArch32 code on Switch is possible in principle (real prior art exists for it), but the one precedent project we found for this depends on a 32-bit libnx build that isn't publicly available anywhere. This binary just explains that; it doesn't do anything else yet.

## Why this is a separate binary from the launcher

The launcher and this Core can't be one process: launching a specific game means chain-loading from the launcher into whichever Core matches that game's architecture (`envSetNextLoad`, the same mechanism homebrew forwarders use). A Switch process runs in one execution state for its whole lifetime, so a future real 32-bit engine has to be its own binary anyway — splitting the 64-bit engine out now means adding that later is "point the launcher at a new NRO," not "rewrite everything."

This binary always expects a package name (passed as `argv[1]` — `argv[0]` has to stay this binary's own real path, since libnx's `romfsInit()` depends on it to find and read this NRO's embedded assets). Launching it directly without a valid package argument just shows a message pointing back at the launcher — it isn't meant to be run standalone.

## Building

Requires [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) with `devkitA64` and `libnx` installed.

```sh
export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro
make            # builds VNX-Translation-Core-x64.nro at the repo root
make -C core32  # builds the x32 placeholder
```

### Dependencies (via pacman/devkitPro)

```

## Status

Only one game has ever actually been run against this engine — **Hill Climb Racing 1.67.0** (Fingersoft) — fully playable (touch, real audio, real threads, persistent saves, ~locked 60fps). Two deterministic crashes found via hardware testing and `.eh_frame` unwind-table analysis are patched, both signature-gated to this exact `libgame.so` build so a mismatched version is left untouched (see `source/compat/games/game_hillclimb.cpp`):
- **Shop/IAP crash** — the Google-Play shop builder populates its product list from a store backend that doesn't exist here, leaving it empty, then unconditionally reads past the end of it. Fixed with three coordinated patches: `getMarketVariation()` claims Google Play so the builder takes a sane branch, the doomed populate call is NOP'd, and the empty-vector virtual-call is branched over. That last patch initially targeted the element-load instruction the disassembly pointed at, but hardware kept crashing one instruction later — there's at least one more code path into that block than static analysis found — so the fix instead patches the actual faulting instruction directly, covering every path into it regardless of how many there turn out to be.
- **Racing null-deref crash** — a vehicle skin lookup (`SkinProvider::find`) returns null when the skin map is empty, and the caller dereferences it with no null check. Guarded to fall through to "no skin matched" instead.
